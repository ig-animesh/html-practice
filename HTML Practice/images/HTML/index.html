        <span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.penpencil.physicswala" target="_blank"><b>Physics Wallah</b></a></span>, or <em>"PW"</em>, was founded in <u>2016</u> as a YouTube channel hosted by <span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alakh-pandey-physicswallah-4baaa8227/?originalSubdomain=in" target="_blank"><b>Alakh Pandey</b></a></span>, an educator hailing from <em>Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh</em>. The channel was initially focused on teaching the physics curriculum for the Joint Entrance Examinations (JEE), a popular entrance examination in India. Due to Pandey's style of teaching and the introduction of cheap mobile data connections in India during the same time, the channel grew rapidly, reaching over 2 million followers in 2019. In 2020, Pandey along with co-founder Prateek Maheshwari developed the Physics Wallah app. The app was initially designed for students aspiring to take the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) and offered courses similar to those of competing companies at an affordable rate. Over the next few years, Physics Wallah expanded their offerings by launching courses for other competitive exams.

        As of January 2023, the Physics Wallah app had been downloaded over 20 million times on the Android Play Store. The Physics Wallah YouTube channel amassed 9.73 million subscribers during the same period. In June 2022, the company became a unicorn company after being valued at over $1.1 billion following its first funding round where it raised $100 million in funding from various venture capital firms. During the same time, PW also launched its first offline center named Vidyapeeth in Kota, Rajasthan.By November 2023, Physics Wallah had expanded to 67 offline centers in 34 cities across India. However, in the same month, Physics Wallah laid off 150 employees, amounting to 0.8% of its workforce, citing performance reasons.
        
        In September 2024, the company raised $210 million in funding at $2.8 billion valuation.</p>
